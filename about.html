  <p>  Zaha Hadid was born on 31 October 1950 in Baghdad, Iraq, to an upper-class Iraqi family. Her father Muhammad al-Hajj Husayn Hadid was a wealthy industrialist from Mosul. He co-founded the left-liberal al-Ahali group in 1932, a significant political organisation in the 1930s and 1940s. He was the co-founder of the National Democratic Party in Iraq and served as minister of finance after the overthrow of the monarch after the 1958 Iraqi coup d'état for the government of General Abd al-Karim Qasim. Her mother Wajiha al-Sabunji was an artist from Mosul while her brother Foulath Hadid was a writer, accountant and expert on Arab affairs. In the 1960s Hadid attended boarding schools in England and Switzerland.</p>

  <p>In 1972 Hadid moved to London to study at the Architectural Association School of Architecture. There she studied with Rem Koolhaas, Elia Zenghelis and Bernard Tschumi. Koolhaas, described her at graduation as "a planet in her own orbit." Zenghelis described her as the most outstanding pupil he ever taught. "We called her the inventor of the 89 degrees. Nothing was ever at 90 degrees." He recalled that she was less interested in details, such as staircases. "The way she drew a staircase you would smash your head against the ceiling, and the space was reducing and reducing, and you would end up in the upper corner of the ceiling. She couldn’t care about tiny details. Her mind was on the broader pictures—when it came to the joinery she knew we could fix that later. She was right."</p>

    <p>She opened her own architectural firm, Zaha Hadid Architects, in London in 1980. She then began her career teaching architecture, first at the Architectural Association, then, over the years at Harvard Graduate School of Design, Cambridge University, the University of Chicago, the Hochschule für bildende Künste in Hamburg, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Columbia University. She earned her early reputation with her lecturing and colourful and radical early designs and projects, which were widely published in architectural journals but remained largely unbuilt. Following her death in March 2016, Michael Kimmelman of the New York Times wrote: "...her soaring structures left a mark on skylines and imaginations and in the process re-shaped architecture for the modern age...Hadid embodied, in its profligacy and promise, the era of so-called starchitects who roamed the planet in pursuit of their own creative genius, offering miracles, occasionally delivering."

    <p>The MODERN ART movement preceded the trends of modern design. In painting, modernism began with the IMPRESSIONIISTS and others who used ABSTRACTION in their work. Modern interior design grew out of the decorative arts, notably ART DECO, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It reached its peak in the 1950s and '60s, which is why designers and decorators today may refer to modern design as being "MID-CENTURY." While not suitable for everyone's tastes, modern design can be a strong selling point for a home, with buyers likely to appreciate the clean lines and SIMPLICITY that help define modern design as a major AESTHETIC style.</p> -->
